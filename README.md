## Task 1: Monolith Hero Banner with Logo Slider

### Description

For this task, I recreated the "Monolith hero banner with logo slider" module from the [Monolith AI website](https://www.monolithai.com/). The client provided specific feedback, which I addressed:
1. Reduced the spacing between the two Call-to-Action (CTA) buttons.
2. Implemented a rotating logo slider that pauses when the mouse hovers over a logo.

### Implementation Highlights

- Utilized the Atom design pattern for modularity and reusability.
- Integrated the Tailwind CSS framework for styling and responsiveness.
- Implemented the rotating logo slider with smooth transitions.
- Achieved real-time feedback for spacing adjustment.

## Task 2: Calculator

### Description

For the second task, I recreated a calculator using JavaScript, React, or jQuery, following the Atom Design pattern.

### Implementation Highlights

- Developed a fully functional calculator with arithmetic operations.
- Ensured real-time input validation and error handling.
- Integrated the Tailwind CSS framework for styling and responsiveness.
- Implemented a clear functionality to reset the calculator.
